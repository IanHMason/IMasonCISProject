          My name is Ian Mason and I recently completed a degree from El Camino College in CIS/Cyber Security. 
          I had previously graduated from El Camino with a degree in History and Philosophy before continuing on 
          to UCLA for a Bachelor's in both subjects. I am a father of 3, including a recent El Camino graduate. 
          I have recently begun working with a non-profit music-related charity as their Operational Supervisor 
          for Festivals and enjoy traveling the country for music festivals. I plan to continue taking classes at 
          El Camino in anything computer related I can to continue learning more.

          Not sure what my favorite site would be but 
          <a href="https://www.elcamino.edu/academics/online-education/canvas-students.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            Canvass
          </a> 
          would be one of the most used for me.
